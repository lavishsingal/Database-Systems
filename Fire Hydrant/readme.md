How to compile and run the java Program?
Files included:
1) createdb.sql
2) dropdb.sql
3) hw2.java

a) First create the database using the file createdb.sql. This will create tables(building,firehydrant,firebuilding) with metadata and index for each spatial table.
b) Now compile the hw2.java file in command prompt by going to the path where your file is located.
c) run the command: javac hw2.java (assuming all classpath and path is properly set, I had set these lib and other usefull files in the Environmental variables)
d) Now run the hw2.class file using comman : java hw2 query_type [object type other parameters|demo number]
e) It will show the result in the command prompt accordingly


NOTE: I used coardinates start from upper-left side.
